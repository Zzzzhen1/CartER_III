# Precaution to use these files in 3D printing
- The models used in the project are developed using Fusion 360, whose education license is free to access as a Cambridge student (still valid by 08/2023)
- For any changes user want to make in the system, please use the Fusion 360 software to access the files in the /3D_Printing/src/ folder.
- In the demo videos and images, the models are mostly 3D printed using Generic Tough PLA.
- For direct printing of the models, please use the files in /3D_Printing/stl/, which can be processed by any 3D slicer software (e.g., UltiMaker Cura), then generate the sliced version of the stl files for printing.
- The melting temperature of the Tough PLA is about **150C to 180C** (might be slightly different for different manufacturer), which can be melted by the running stepper motor. This might cause the loose band and lowered tension in the band.
